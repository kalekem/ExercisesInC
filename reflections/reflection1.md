**1. Written sprint reflection**

During Sprint 1, we gathered several project ideas, brainstormed  them and picked one that we thought was challenging but also exciting enough for us to enjoy working on it. Once we had decided on our project, we assigned each other different tasks to work on. Some of the tasks included getting “hello openGL” and “hello physics engine” to work in our computers. I was new to openGL and physics engine and I spent quite some time, reading online tutorials and watching youtube videos before I got them to work. I also played with the Blender software, creating 3D objects and played with the blender physics engine just to get an idea on how physics engine generally works. I also contributed to some of the tasks that had been assigned to other members of the team on trello board, just to make sure that we were all helping each other on relevant resources for the project. 

For the sprint review, I read  chapter 1- 4 of Head First C and chapter 1 - 3 of ThinkOS. I however, did not know that there were reading-questions that had been posted and so I was a little bit unprepared for the sprint review as I did not know what type of questions were going to be asked. I just had a general understanding of the chapters. After the sprint review, I went back and reviewed the chapters in detail and finished the ThinkOS reading questions.  

At the beginning of the sprint, I felt some pressure especially on coming up with project ideas and team formation since we immediately started working on the projects the first day of class. I was a little nervous at the beginning but once we formed our teams and started working on the project proposals, it became easier and we were able to come up with a project idea, researched on it and right now we’re making progress on the project. I was able to learn and discover new things during and even after the project proposal in this sprint process. 

For sprint retrospective, we did well as a team in discussing what project idea to work on. We were also able to research on the topics related to our project and shared the resources. We decided that we would need to be more active in our group chat system since three of our team members are from Brandeis. Active communication would ensure that we all stay informed and all matters related to the project are in good progress. Going into the next sprint, we will start coding the parts of the project that require coding and create the objects we will need in blender. We decided that we will be working with blender, openGL and the physics engine. We have managed so far to create the curve on blender and get the blender physics engine to work. Our next task then is to get it working on openGL.

I read chapters   1-4 HFC but only worked on exercises from chapter 1 and 2.

**3. Think OS reading question answers**

I read chapters 1 and 2 of ThinkOS during this sprint process.

Links to ThinkOS reading questions:

  1) Chapter One: https://github.com/kalekem/ExercisesInC/wiki/Chapter-One:-Compilation
  
  2) Chapter Two: https://github.com/kalekem/ExercisesInC/wiki/Chapter-Two:-Processes
  
  
**4. Exam question(s) and solution**

This question draws from chapter two of thinkOS textbook - Processes

**Q**. What is multitasking in operating systems? 


**A**.Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to allow a user to perform more than one task at a time. 
This is achieved as the OS can issue an interrupt to a running process at any time, saves its hardware state, and then
resumes the process later on. However, the user will have an illusion that the program is running continuosly on a dedicated 
processor. They won't need to think or worry about the interruptions that happen.
